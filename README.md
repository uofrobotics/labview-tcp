# labview-tcp
Getting tcp communication with labview and a myrio-1900 working.

# Usage: to use a project file

1) clone the repo
2) make a copy of "labview-tcp.lvprojremovethesewords" (DO NOT MODIFY THE FILE DIRECTLY)
3) remove "removethesewords" from the extension of the copy template project file and "COPY" in the name. (this is because the lvproj file may contain sensitive/private info, so by making a copy of the template you can modify it as you wish)
Note: all .aliases and .lvlps files will be auto generated by labview for you, dont worry about them.
4) you should now have the project file: "labview-tcp.lvproj" and the original template "labview-tcp.lvprojremovethesewords". Do not delete the template for git reasons
5) if the VI's are not already loaded into the project, then on the myrio right click -> add -> folder (auto-populating) and chose the "code" folder.
6) open the new project file and have fun!
